INF560 Project (Parallel Computing)

The N-body problem has been widely studied and applied in various fields. Since the traditional Brute Force algorithm is computationally expensive and over time-consuming, the Barnes Hut quad-tree algorithm is proposed to simulate the particle force, which greatly improves the efficiency of the algorithm. Nowadays, the advent of parallel computing has given new born to these legacy algorithms. With MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA, we enforce parallelization at various degrees to experiment with the performance improvement upon Brute Force and Barnes Hut algorithms. The performance evaluation by exploiting different parallel paradigms as per the input scope are given in details.
